  ### Constraints:
   It’s difficult to work around everyone’s availabilities to schedule meetings

## All our meetings so far


  * In person: we have met in tutorial and outside of class
  * Online: on the weekend
  * When: during tutorials, after class, around dinner
  * Where: in tutorial rooms, online, BA3200
  * Who was there?: Everyone 

  ### Rough meeting minutes/notes.
   ##### First meeting (Online)
   we brainstormed ideas for alternative projects, these were our ideas:
   
    * Discord bot - not sure what functionality for this
    * Law and order: An app that allow users to search lawyers nearby
    * Free food pokemon go - map with free food, pings users when they’re near a free food location
    * Getting recipes out of long blog posts - maybe too difficult
    * Add notes to places in google maps
    * Image lookup - lookup things on the internet based on an image
    * BikeMyWay: Using google maps api, show user how to bike from point A to point B
    * EBucketList: Using BestBuy, Amazon, eBay, and other apis, compile a list of items from the online shopping sites 
      that you want to purchase from, you can also add alerts so it notifies you when something goes on sale
    * The random food thing urbanspoon used to have - when looking for food, can select random and it will pick random 
      culinary type and show restaurants nearby
   
   #### The second meeting (during tutorial) 
   we tired querying data using Amazon, BestBuy, and Walmart’s APIs. We were able to successfully obtain the API key for Walmart and got some data back. Our BestBuy API key is still pending for approval
   
   #### The third meeting (slack) 
   we decided on the project we want to work on, tried to get a rough idea of how our app is going look like, and wrote down some of the rough test cases
   
   #### The fourth meeting (slack) 
   we continued to work on the documentation
   
   #### For the fifth meeting (in-person)
   we continued to work on the documentation
    
## Shared documents:
  * We used a google doc to keep meeting minutes and drafts of our documentations
  * We also share some information relevant to the project on slack


## Logistics of future meetings
  ### Future meetings
   We usually meet on weekend nights on Slack, however depending on the circumstance we will also meet in person
  ### Agile/Scrum/Kanban?
   * We plan to work in scrum process
   * We will use Jira for tracking our work
    * Backlog
     * JIRA
   * Story points and hours
   * 1 story point = 1 day
    * we'll assign story points based on the amount of work
   * Regular sprints
    * we'll do weekly sprints until the project is finished
   * Scrummaster - Yushan
   * Product Owner - David
   * Standup meetings
    * We'll do weekly stand ups on Fridays during the tutorial hour
    * We'll use online meetings as a back up
      
## Strategy for Spliting work between individuals
  ### Divide web client, endpoints across the team
   * Web Client: we’ll take on the web client that works with our skills and capabilities and divide the work as evenly as possible 
   * Endpoints: we’ll take on the endpoints that works with our skills and capabilities and divide the work as evenly as possible

  ### Roles for individuals
   * Front-end: Sophie, Gurleen 
   * Back-end: David, Isabelle, Yushan, Madu
  ### Repo (Wo)man
   Sophie
  ### TDD person
   Everyone writes their own test
  ### CI person
   Travis - Madu
  ### Storing and Sharing Documents
   We store and share documents on GitHub, slack, google drive and JIRA
  
## Push commits on repository

  * When a person creates a new change to commit to master, one creates pull request. Someone else reviews it and merges it.
  * A person can only commit by themselves when everyone has looked over their code and approved the code change
  * A PR is necessary when a key piece of the code is broken and needs to be fixed without affecting other parts of the code

## Message Board
  * Slack

## Track Progress
  * We will use burndown chart to track progress
  * We will assign story points for each bug
