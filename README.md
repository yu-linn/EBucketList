 <h1>EBucketList</h1>

 <h2>Description</h2>
 A wishlist app where you can track a list of items from the online shopping sites (such as Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart)that you want to purchase from, and get notified when something goes on sale or has a promotional deal.


 <h2>Background</h2>
With many e-commerce websites offering competitive prices and products, it can be difficult to track the price of a favourite product for when it goes on sale.
